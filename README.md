# Cpp-Doubly-Linked-Lists

---

This is an implementation of the doubly-linked list data structure in C++.
The code supports:
- Inserting a new node at the head
- Inserting a new node elsewhere
- Removing a node at the head
- Removing a node elsewhere
- Searching through the list by desired data value
- Printing from the front
- Printing from the back

I hope this project will be of help to you. Thanks!
